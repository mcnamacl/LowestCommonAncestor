# LowestCommonAncestor
__________________________

This repository contains the code for getting the Lowest Common Ancestor of two nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph. 
It makes use of the org.jgrapht.graph library to represent the DAG. The test code gives 97% coverage and the missing 
3% is due to lines that will never get run due to exception handling.
